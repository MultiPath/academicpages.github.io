# Welcome!

I am currently a research scientist at the [Meta AI (FAIR team)](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/) in New York City. 


I obtained my Ph.D. degree at [the department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong](http://www.eee.hku.hk/) in 2018 and I was supervised by [Prof. Victor O.K. Li](https://www.eee.hku.hk/people/vli/). My doctoral work explored [efficient neural machine translation systems](https://hub.hku.hk/handle/10722/265405).

I spent a wonderful time visiting the [CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr), New York University working with [Prof. Kyunghyun Cho](http://www.kyunghyuncho.me/).
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree at [the Electronic Engineering Department, Tsinghua University](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2014 with the guidance of [Prof. Ji Wu](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/eeen/3784/2010/20101219135614305780920/20101219135614305780920_.html).


### Research Interests
My general research goal is to improve representation learning and generation of all kinds of data in the real world, including natural language, speech and vision.
I have been focusing on developing efficient and effective models for different modalities and leading multiple research directions, including non-autoregressive text generation and neural field-based image synthesis.




<!-- ### Active Learning for Discovering Extremes

My recent research activity centers around discovery and prediction of extreme
events by leveraging recent advancements in deep neural networks and Bayesian
statistics. Check out this quick 3 minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYbB9TayxmQ" target="_blank">video</a> for a snapshot into my current work. I hope to have some publications out shortly surrounding these techniques.

### Data-Driven Turbulence Modeling

My research investigates the fundamental mechanisms that exist in complex and chaotic fluid flows by leveraging large, high-fidelity datasets to inform and validate reduced-order modeling strategies. These mechanisms are of importance as they govern engineering quantities such as noise, drag, and efficiency. Unfortunately, both high-fidelity datasets and reduced order models, alone, can only provide limited insight into these mechanisms. In much of my research, I look to pose optimization problems where our models assimilate/learn various properties of turbulence from the data to yield reduced-order models that are both predictive and general (i.e. applicable to other flows geometries and conditions). In short, this research takes a constrained-''machine learning'' approach, where the Navier-Stokes equations remain a central component of the model.


To learn from the data, turbulent flows are decomposed into their most energetic components (using Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) and then modeled via linear amplification theory of the equations of motion (Resolvent Analysis). Check out the video above on how we decompose massive datasets (numerous TB) into SPOD modes and then seek to model their theoretical equivalent with resolvent analysis.
